# Building an Event-Driven Architecture with AWS

#### Overview
In this lab, you'll build a **sophisticated event-driven architecture** on AWS using **SNS**, **SQS**, and **Lambda**, and extend it with **S3** triggers, **API Gateway** endpoints, and **CloudWatch** monitoring. You'll design **message patterns**, configure **dead-letter queues (DLQs)**, handle **FIFO ordering**, implement **batch processing**, and set up **monitoring and cost optimization** strategies. You'll also explore **operational procedures** and build a basic **testing framework** for validation.

This lab guides you through the steps of architecting, implementing, and optimizing an asynchronous event-driven workflow that is scalable, fault-tolerant, and observable.

#### Architecture Goals
- Build an architecture with **decoupled producers and consumers**
- Enable **message routing** via **SNS topics** and **SQS subscriptions**
- Use **standard queues** and **FIFO queues** for appropriate message guarantees
- Configure **dead-letter queues** for error handling
- Apply **batch processing** for performance and cost efficiency
- Trigger workflows from **S3 uploads** and **API Gateway POST calls**
- Design **monitoring dashboards** and **alerts** using **CloudWatch**
- Implement **cost-optimization** techniques using AWS-native tools
- Document **operational runbooks** and **test cases**

This workshop assumes you already have basic familiarity with AWS services like IAM, Lambda, and S3. Youâ€™ll also benefit from knowledge of JSON message formats, retry policies, and async patterns.

#### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
**SNS** is a managed pub/sub messaging service that enables message fan-out to multiple subscribers. It helps route messages to multiple destinations like Lambda, SQS, and HTTP endpoints.

#### Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
**SQS** is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of microservices. It supports **standard queues** (at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering) and **FIFO queues** (exactly-once processing, strict ordering).

#### AWS Lambda
**AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your backend code in response to triggers such as SQS messages, S3 events, and API Gateway HTTP calls. It scales automatically and supports concurrency settings and DLQ handling for robust message processing.

#### Amazon S3
**Amazon S3** is a storage service for objects like JSON files, images, and logs. You can trigger **Lambda functions** when a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, making it ideal for ingesting event data like user submissions or batch inputs.

#### Amazon API Gateway
**API Gateway** allows you to expose HTTPS endpoints to trigger AWS services. It integrates directly with **Lambda** to receive incoming requests (e.g., a quiz submission), which can then be routed via SNS or processed directly.

#### Amazon CloudWatch
**CloudWatch** is the monitoring, logging, and alerting backbone of AWS. You'll use it to:
- View Lambda execution logs
- Monitor error rates and latency for SQS, Lambda, and API Gateway
- Set alarms and create dashboards for visibility
- Query logs using CloudWatch Logs Insights

#### DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
A **DLQ** is a standard SQS queue used to capture failed messages after exceeding retry attempts. DLQs are critical for troubleshooting failures and maintaining resilience.

#### Monitoring and Cost Optimization
We'll use **CloudWatch Metrics**, **Logs**, and **Alarms** to track system behavior. You'll also use **AWS Cost Explorer**, **CloudWatch Logs Insights**, and **Lambda cost calculators** to optimize expenses.
